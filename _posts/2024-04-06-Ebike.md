## DIY e-bike
I spent a large part of the last summer building a powerful e-bike from parts I purchased from tori.fi. I would describe this more as a mechanical engineering project, than an electrical one. As the controller, gas, LCD-screen all work just by plugging the wires into the connectors. However there were a lot of issues to be solved in other areas. Biggest was the mounting of the battery. I could not rely on the usual method of attaching it into a battery dock and sliding that in and out. My bike frame did not allow enough space for that so I came up with some creative mounting mechanisms to allow me to push it against the frame of the bike tight enough to function perfectly. I also had to completely retune the rear gears, because the bike used to have 9 rear gears, but the e-bike hub motor has only 7.


## Learning
I learned about how to make mounting systems that are weatherproof and can withstand wear and tear. Also about the After over 1000km on this e-bike I am happy to report that it still works.


## Future improvements 
I have plans to modify/"hack" the electronics of the e-bike to add some new functions. This would turn this more into an electornics project
