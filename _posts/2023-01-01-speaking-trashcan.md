## Speaking bottle trash

 In high school i was involved in the school board. During a meeting we had an idea to make a speaking bottle/can trash similar to the ones in amusement park Linnanm√§ki. This would possibly increase our profits because the school board got the money from the bottles/cans. I built this easy project with nothing but an arduino uno, ultrasound module, cheap speaker and a mosfet amplifier.
 
  I recorded the voice line my self and had to actually do a lot of processing to it so it would fit within the arduino unos memory. A few seconds of low resolution audio were all that would fit to the 32kb flash memory of the uno.
 I could have of course ordered an sd-card module but I wanted to get this project done quickly with the parts I had at hand. The speaking trash can gained attention in our school and just maybe caused increased our school boards bottle money income.
