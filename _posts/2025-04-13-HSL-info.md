## HSL info screen
In this project I built an infoscreen displaying public transport times of our local bus, tram, and train stations. It has been very useful to have this in the entryway of our apartment as we use public transport a lot for commuting. The display UI is actually provided by HSLâ€”see [https://omatnaytot.hsl.fi/](https://omatnaytot.hsl.fi/). Most of the trickery came from using a 10+ year old samsung galaxy tablet that couldnt even connect to the internet due to end of support from samsung. I managed to root the tablet, download open source linux software that still supported them(LegacyOS). With this the tablet was able to connect to the internet, use browsers, function properly again.

I also 3d printed in 2 different parts an enclosure for the tablet and its chraging cable to make it more visually pleasing.
