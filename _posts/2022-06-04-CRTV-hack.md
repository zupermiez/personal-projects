## CRTV = Cathode Ray Tube Television

In this short project I got an old crtv portable radio/television. However the crtv part was only designed to work with an UHF/VHF antenna. However these broadcasts have long stopped atleast in Finland. The raspberry pi however has a composite video output using a 3.5mm headphone jack. Doing this required a good amount of researching datasheets. Finally I found the one with a video output. There I could disconnect the chip from the circuit board and insert my own wires leading to the 3.5mm video output jack. Finding a 4 pin headphone jack with solderable wires turned out to be surprisingly difficult, because all newer and higher quality cables used some thin fibres that were definitely not solderable. Luckily I found an older jack with copper wires.
