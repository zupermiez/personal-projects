# Building an arduino based plotter

Our design was built on custom designed 3d printed parts and 4 linear rods in the shape of a H. 2 stepper motors were connected with a single belt in a "CORE-XY" configuration. This minimizes the mass of the moving unit improving speed and accuracy. This however meant that we couldnt use the default settings on GRBL, because those are made for straight cartesian belt systems and ours was essentially turned by 45 degrees. For lifting the pen we used a simple servo motor attached to the pen and some rubber bands to keep the pen in tension with the paper. The hardware side was not too complex to get working but getting [grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) to work reliably and getting all the parameters and motor directions tuned took a while.


## Components
 2 x Nema 17 stepper motor
 1 x Tower sg90 servo motor
 2 x limit switches
 2 x A4988 drivers
 1 x Arduino Uno R3

## Learning
In this project reliability, accuracy, calibration and software for me the biggest learning opportunities. The physical build of the machine was fairly simple, but the This project taught me a lot about gcode, how to manually create it, how to create gcode from vector drawings using plugins. I also learned a lot about GRBL and its parameters. Working in a group was also new with robotics projects.

## Challenges and Issues:

- Limit switch placement → We decided to optimize the placement of the switches close to the circuit to reduce wire clutter.
- Wiring the servo motor for the pen mechanism → We opted to leave the servo motor wires free to move, as we found that they didn't get stuck on anything.
- Pen mechanism design and functionality → We solved the issue by creating a prototype, which helped us identify the problems. We addressed these by 3D printing a new mechanism that worked perfectly. We also looked at online examples for inspiration.
- Motors and drivers → Our group encountered many defective or imprecise components, which caused headaches during the testing phase.
- ESP32 issues → We switched to Arduino as it worked more reliable better.
- GRBL library → Problems arose with hard limits due to minor inaccuracies.
- Frame and chassis construction → After several prototypes and trials, we achieved a functional system.
- Unnecessary delay on the servo motor lifting the pen → A one-second delay had been added unnecessarily, which significantly slowed progress. Fixing it was easy
