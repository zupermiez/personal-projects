## Scale of Waste system

 I built a prototype for a food waste reduction system that targets elementary-high school aged children to reduce their food waste. The system relies heavily on visualization and gamefication of the food waste reduction process. The system uses scales connected to screens in order to display live time feedback on cartoon visuals, achievements and relatable comparisons.

 *Here is a photo of the prototype from the live demo. The official visualization screen was next to my laptop but the cameras chose not to film it*



## Technical details
I built a prototype using a 25kg load cell and a custom built scale connected to a Raspberry Pi 4B and a monitor. As the load cell detected the increase in waste the Pi would play a food waste animation video that had correctly timed **overlapping text with the exact waste amount and even some extrapolations of similar waste amounts f.e. over a month**



## Publicity
I made it into the finals of the Beyond 2030 challenge with this project. In Turku I got to present my vision and prototype to a crowd of experts from various industries.


## Learning
 I made all the visualizations from scratch by using Cartoon animator software. This was probably the biggest learning curve since I had no previous experience in animation. Then I also had to design a raspi based system that would be realible enough for the demo. And even though it was the newest pi at the time, running a python script with inputs while doing video playback forced me to learn how to work within te constaints of the hardware. On top of that there was the live presentation in front of cameras and an audience.
